# Portfolio Website Wireframe
## One-Page Immersive Experience

### Tech Stack
- React + Next.js (TypeScript)
- Three.js for 3D graphics
- GSAP for smooth animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling

- Disable complex shaders, use simpler materials
- Convert some 3D elements to 2D parallax
- Touch gestures for card interactions
- Simplified scroll animations

### Performance Targets
- 60 FPS on desktop
- 30 FPS minimum on mobile
- First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive < 3s

## 📊 Analytics & Tracking

Consider tracking:
- Scroll depth
- Section time spent
- Interactions with 3D elements
- Resume downloads
- Most engaging sections

This helps optimize for what recruiters actually care about!

---

**Remember:** The key is balancing "wow factor" with usability. Make sure the animations enhance rather than distract from your actual qualifications. Every animation should feel purposeful, not gratuitous.

Good luck building! This is going to be 🔥

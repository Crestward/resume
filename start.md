role: you are seasoned full stack web developer with an eye for design

✅ COMPLETED - About Section Rewrite:
  Transformed keyword-heavy resume text into narrative storytelling:
  - Para 1: Origin story (automation → data discovery → late-night API reverse engineering at Zeeh Africa)
  - Para 2: Growth journey (Python/Spark/Azure → 40% efficiency gains → mastering real-world messy data)
  - Para 3: Current chapter (Beck-AI co-founder → production-focused AI → business-first mindset)

  Result: Personal, vivid narrative that shows progression and real impact

✅ COMPLETED FIXES (Round 2 - DEEP FIX):

  ✅ HERO SECTION SPACING - DEEP FIX:
    ROOT CAUSE: GSAP fadeInUp animation started icons 30px BELOW normal position (y: 30),
    causing visual overlap during animation. Tailwind margin classes were being applied
    but animation positioning overrode visual spacing.

    FIXES APPLIED:
    1. Hero.tsx - Switched to flexbox layout with explicit spacing
       - Container now uses: flex flex-col items-center
       - Title margin: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 3rem) = 32px-48px based on viewport
       - Subtitle margin: clamp(3rem, 8vw, 5rem) = 48px-80px based on viewport
       - Using inline styles for guaranteed application

    2. FloatingIcons.tsx - Removed top margin that was redundant
       - Changed mt-8 to marginTop: 0 (spacing handled by subtitle margin-bottom)

    3. gsapHelpers.ts - Fixed fadeInUp animation
       - Changed from: y: 30 (starts below, animates up)
       - Changed to: y: 0, scale: 0.8 (starts in position, scales up)
       - Icons now animate in-place instead of moving upward
       - No more visual overlap during animation

    RESULT: Generous responsive spacing with animations that don't interfere

  ✅ Made hero icons stagnant on mobile (removed animation, only animates on desktop with md:animate-floatWave)
  ✅ Made hero background more obvious on mobile (increased particle count to 2500, size to 0.04, opacity to 0.8)

  ✅ WORK EXPERIENCE PADDING - FIXED:
    - Changed from Tailwind classes to inline style with clamp()
    - padding: 'clamp(1.5rem, 4vw, 2.5rem)' - scales from 1.5rem to 2.5rem based on viewport
    - Content now has proper breathing room from card edges on all screen sizes

  ✅ SKILLS MATRIX OVERLAY - DEEP FIX:
    ROOT CAUSE: Masonry grid uses absolutely positioned items without container height,
    causing items to overflow and cover content below

    FIXES APPLIED:
    1. Masonry.tsx - Modified grid calculation to return maxHeight
       - Changed: return { items: gridItems, maxHeight: Math.max(...colHeights) }
       - Container now has: style={{ height: grid.maxHeight || 'auto' }}
       - Grid container properly contains all absolutely positioned items

    2. Masonry.css - Added z-index to item wrappers
       - .item-wrapper now has z-index: 1

    3. SkillsMatrix.tsx - Removed min-height constraint & adjusted z-index
       - Removed min-h-[600px] (was forcing unnecessary height)
       - Grid wrapper: style={{ zIndex: 1 }}
       - Legend: style={{ zIndex: 100 }} (much higher than grid items)
       - Instructions: style={{ zIndex: 100 }}
       - Increased bottom margin to mb-20 on mobile (mb-12 on desktop)

    RESULT: Container now has calculated height, items stay within bounds,
    legend renders below with proper spacing and high z-index
